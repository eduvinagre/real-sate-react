## Overview

It was my first approach to React as I have only been using Vanilla. In this project I was able to work with animations, carousel and also accordion. Even thought it's not a very complex work I was happy to see how I am evolving as a developer and sharpening my solving problems skills. It's also full responsive.

### Deploy

https://real-sate-react.vercel.app

### The challenge

The main challenge here was to make my first project using React, creating animations, carousel and other built in solutions such as icons. In the end I'm very proud of what I've achieved, specially developing my solving problems skills.
